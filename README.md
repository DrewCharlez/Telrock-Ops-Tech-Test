Cloud; due to the fast delivery of devops 
Reduce the cost of hardware in data centers
Scalability server capacity will vary according to traffic provisiong 



Infrastructure automation; Having tasks executed via automation tools is allowing Ops engineers to manage configuration and deployment on multiple servers automatically, this achieves faster delivery of features, faster resoultion of problems and gives Ops engineers more time to innovate rather than fix and mantain. 

CI/CD Pipelines; The development practice of requiring developers to frequently integrate code in to a shared repo such as GIt and then fetched from a continous integration tool like jenkins has permitted Devs to release code more often and with more confidence.
When Devs commit code an auto build is triggered and automatically deployed on a test environment,if the test shows a bug devs can check the last commit to apply a fix, this is allowing for faster delivery of software and resolution of problems as the Devs will always be provided feedback on commited code.
Its improving the consistence, quality and efficency of software and infrastructure.


Site Reliability engineering; They are the core of the infrastructure and respond to all incidents. The are involved in all aspects of the infrustructure from operations, capacity planning and software development. 

I'm open to being involved in all aspects of infrustructure, however the below will be of intrest to me:
Web technologies
Create and mantain automated tools used in deployment 
Coding and scripting for automating routine task
System administration of Linux environments
System monitoring
Support cloud/virtualised infrastructure
CI/CD pipelines set up of continuos integration and delivery
