Cloud; is the go to service platform for operations of businesses supported by Ops engineers. 
Due to the fast delivery of software features, continous integration, automation deployment and faster resolution to problem solving a fast implemention of computing resources is always required, and cloud techology provides this by means of scalability, the provisioning of server capacity according to traffic.
This has reduced the time it takes to make resources available and cut cost of hardware and allow you to pay for what you use at increased speed.
With requirements changing frequently cloud provides you with flexibility, control and management.

Infrastructure automation; Having tasks executed via automation tools is allowing Ops engineers to manage configuration and deployment on multiple servers automatically. 
This achieves faster delivery of features, faster resoultion of problems and gives Ops engineers more time to innovate rather than fix and mantain. 

CI/CD Pipelines; The development practice of requiring developers to frequently integrate code in to a shared repo such as GIt and then fetched from a continous integration tool like jenkins.
This has permitted Devs to release code more often and with more confidence.
When Devs commit code an auto build is triggered and automatically deployed on a test environment.
If the test shows a bug devs can check the last commit to apply a fix, this is allowing for faster delivery of software and resolution of problems as the Devs will always be provided feedback on commited code.
Its improving the consistence, quality and efficency of software and infrastructure. 
Reliability is also good here as in the circumstances of failure, you can easily roll back to previous stable version

Site Reliability Engineering; My undestanding of this role is that they are the core of the infrastructure and respond to all incidents.  
They are involved in all aspects of the infrustructure from operations, capacity planning, design review and software development.
Their primary focus is reliability of services and collaboration and communication of all teams. 
Just to emphasis, When I say reliability of services I mean system uptime, release velocity, performance tuning.
They are also there to improve the communication and collaboration of teams involved in the infrastructures up keep.
SRE do not only focus on intenal infrustructure needs and imporovements they also deal with the end users, understanding thier needs and how best to cater to them.
I will add to this by saying SRE's what works well and then emphasis 
I'm open to being involved in all aspects of infrustructure, however the below will be of intrest to me:
Web technologies;
nginx LAMP
Create and mantain automated tools used in deployment 
Coding and scripting for automating routine task
System administration of Linux environments
System monitoring
Support cloud/virtualised infrastructure
Set up of continuos integration and deliver pipelines
Trouble shooting and analysis of issues
Documentation write up
Storage management
